## Projects
### Facial Recognition System | Python, Computer Vision, PCA, LDA | October 2024
This project involved building a facial recognition system using PCA and Eigenfaces. Data augmentation, face alignment, and transfer learning improved the model's robustness, achieving 84% classification accuracy on a small dataset of 32 test images. Further enhancements, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), clustering, error rate analysis, reconstruction evaluation, and eigenface visualization, reduced misclassification by 43.76% relative to the baseline PCA-only model. The results highlight the potential of combining classical techniques (PCA, LDA) with modern enhancements in facial recognition.

### Image Classification with Deep Learning | Python, CNN, ResNet 18, Transfer Learning | April 2024
Developed deep learning models for image classification on the Imagenette and CIFAR10 datasets from scratch. Achieved 84.5% accuracy with a basic CNN and 92.7% accuracy with ResNet-18 on Imagenette. Improved generalization using regularization techniques such as data augmentation and dropout. Fine-tuned a pre-trained Imagenette model on CIFAR10, achieving 93.4% accuracy. Utilized PyTorch Lightning with early stopping and checkpointing to streamline the training process. Documented performance through detailed analysis of metrics and visualizations.
 
### Used Car Price Prediction | Python, Regression (Linear, Ridge, Lasso), Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors | February 2023
Developed nine machine learning models to predict car prices in the pre-owned car market, achieving 90% accuracy on training data and 91% accuracy on testing data using a linear regression model. Addressed missing data by generating synthetic data and evaluated model performance using R-squared and RMSE metrics. Proposed the adoption of gradient boosting models, such as XGBoost and LightGBM, to better capture intricate patterns in the data and improve predictive accuracy. Enhanced feature engineering by using interaction terms, polynomial features, and combining external data sources, including fuel prices and market trends. Implemented cross-validation to ensure perfect evaluation and prevent overfitting.

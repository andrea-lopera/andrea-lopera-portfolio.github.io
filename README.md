## Projects
### Facial Recognition System
This project involved building a facial recognition system using PCA and Eigenfaces. Data augmentation, face alignment, and transfer learning improved the model's robustness, achieving 84% classification accuracy on a small dataset of 32 test images. Further enhancements, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), clustering, error rate analysis, reconstruction evaluation, and eigenface visualization, reduced misclassification by 43.76% relative to the baseline PCA-only model. The results highlight the potential of combining classical techniques (PCA, LDA) with modern enhancements in facial recognition.

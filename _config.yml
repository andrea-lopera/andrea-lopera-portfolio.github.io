description: "I am a professional with a diverse background, driven by a passion for problem-solving and making a positive impact. My career journey began in Industrial Engineering, where I spent six years sharpening my analytical skills in various production-related roles and using data analysis to boost output and efficiency. Seeking to make a broader and more meaningful contribution to the world, I then shifted to education, earning bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Math Education. Realizing my interests lay at the crossroads of mathematics, data, and societal change, I transitioned into data science, gaining a certification in Applied Data Science. I am currently working toward a master's degree in the field. This path has allowed me to combine my love for numbers with a career focused on positive change."
